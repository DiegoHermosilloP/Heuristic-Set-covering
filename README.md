# Heuristic-Set-covering

The code presented here is a simple heuristic solution to the set covering problem. The objective is to cover 5 regions with 3 stores. Of course, not all regions can be covered by all stores.
The chosen heuristic is to open the cheaper stores first until all the set of stores are opened. It stops until all stores are opened.

Matrix A represents which regions (rows) can be opened for each center (column). As an example, region 5 can be covered by the centers 1 and 2, but not by center 3.
